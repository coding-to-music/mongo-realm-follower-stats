# FollowStats

### Overview of My Submission

As part of the [MongoDB Atlas + Dev hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-mongodb-atlas-hackathon-on-dev-4b6m), I am glad to present [FollowStats](https://followstats.vercel.app/).
FollowStats enables you to be more intentional about building an audience and helps you to track your followers, subscribers from various platforms periodically. It keeps a daily track of your followers and subscribers count. You can view your growth/ decline of your followers and subscribers in an organized dashboard.
It also sends you a weekly overview of your audience to your email every Monday morning at 09:00.

#### My experience

I had previously used MongoDB but was unaware of the cool functionalities like Realm functions, triggers etc.
I was really fascinated by how easy it is to build your backend using MongoDB Realm functions. We can easily import npm packages and use those too. I also used triggers for the first time to fetch followers' count everyday and send email report every Monday.

#### Challenges faced

The major challenge was to figure out the way to fetch followers/ subscribers data from various platforms. I had to try many methods (like using official API, scraping etc.) before I arrived at a method that works.

#### What's next for FollowStats?

- Add more platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn and newsletter platforms like Mailchimp, Convertkit, Buttondown etc.
- Add charts and graphs to visualize followers' growth.
